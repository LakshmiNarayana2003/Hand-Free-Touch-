# Hand-Free-Touch-
Hand-Free Touch uses computer vision to enable touch-free interaction with digital content. By tracking finger movements with OpenCV and Mediapipe, it detects pinch gestures to simulate scrolling actions. Users can scroll through content like YouTube Shorts by moving their fingers, providing an intuitive and accessible control method.

Features
Gesture-Based Interaction: Detects pinch gestures between the index finger and thumb to control scrolling actions.
Real-Time Scrolling: Allows users to scroll through content, such as YouTube Shorts, by moving their fingers up or down.
High Responsiveness: Ensures accurate and smooth gesture detection for a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used
OpenCV: Utilized for capturing and processing video frames.
Mediapipe: Provides hand landmark detection and tracking capabilities.
Pyautogui: Simulates scrolling actions in the browser based on detected gestures.

Usage
Run the Application: Start the Python script to initiate video capture and hand tracking.
Gesture Control: Position your hand in front of the camera. The application will track your fingers and detect pinch gestures.
